			<h2>The living monument</h2>
			

            <p>Welcome to the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum located in Weston, WV. Formerly known as the Weston State Hospital, this West Virginia facility served as a sanctuary for the mentally ill in the mid-1800’s. The history of the building holds fascinating stories of Civil War raids, a gold robbery, the "curative" effects of architecture, and the efforts of determined individuals to help better the lives of the mentally ill. Tour this nationally recognized landmark and see how it left a lasting impression on local and national history. Daily heritage tours are available for both small and large groups.</p>

            		<h2>Designed to house 250 souls</h2>
			
            <p>The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, constructed between 1858 and 1881, is the largest hand-cut stone masonry building in North America, and is purportedly the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin. It was designed by the renowned architect Richard Andrews following the Kirkbride plan, which called for long rambling wings arranged in a staggered formation, assuring that each of the connecting structures received an abundance of therapeutic sunlight and fresh air. The original hospital, designed to house 250 souls, was open to patients in 1864 and reached its peak in the 1950's with 2,400 patients in overcrowded and generally poor conditions. Changes in the treatment of mental illness and the physical deterioration of the facility forced its closure in 1994 inflicting a devastating effect on the local economy, from which it has yet to recover.</p>

<h2>Not for the faint of heart</h2>

<p>The Asylum has had apparition sightings, unexplainable voices and sounds, and other paranormal activity reported in the past by guests, staff, SyFy's Ghost Hunters, Ghost Hunters Academy, the Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures and Paranormal Challenge. Step back in time and see how the mentally insane lived, and died, within these walls.
Thousands have been committed to the asylum over the years, and hundreds unfortunately died here. Decide for yourself if they’re still occupying the historic wards and treatment rooms.</p>

			                   The full tour is well worth it. The tour guides are knowledgeable and some have a personal story to tell about either working at TALA when it was still in operation, or about relatives who were residents there. This brings a perspective to the tour and to the place that makes the tour more a personal experience than I imagined...</p>

			                   We only visited the 1st floor, due to limited time available. This insane asylum is being restored as funds allow and it will be magnificent when completed. It really opens your eyes to what those confined suffered during the experimentation to "cure" mental disease for various reasons. Many brain lobotomies were actually performed in WV at Lakin State Hospital. This structure has much history to offer and I can't wait to return to see the other 4 floors. Absolutely fascinating. </p>
